# TopBar
HTML5 Application for displaying various overlay data on Sony Bravia TVs


Details
=============
TopBar is ideal for Bravia TV users who user an external player to view their media. In short, TopBar overlays a bar of data over an HDMI source...this is fairly useless is you are wanting to use the Android apps on the TV because you would need to close TopBar to access those apps. 

Definitions/details: The overlay is divided into 5 sections, each section is setup to display an image, title, details, and a summary. Each set of 5 sections is a page/extension...more extensions will be added in the future.

TopBar runs on a USB drive plugged into your TV, but it not a download and go. You will need to configure the .js files with your various credentials/details (eg. YOUR_ZIP_CODE for weather). Future updates will work off of a .config file, so that settings can be maintained between updates.

Extensions
==============
Working: 
-Trakt.tv - display the next 5 TV shows from your Trakt.tv account's 'up next' calendar.
